        <p>This Shopify app development workshop is targeted at developers who are looking to jump into app development for ecommerce projects. The workshop will introduce you to a variety of resources you can use to support your development with Shopify.</p>
        <p>Using Ruby on Rails as a backend framework you will start building a base Shopify Private Application to integrate with one of your own development stores. You'll leave with a set of steps you can follow to start up any new app development project and a greater understanding of how clients' or your own shops could be served by a private app.</p>

            <li><span>6:20pm - Why Shopify Apps</span>
            Here we will provide a basic overview of the Shopify CMS. We will go over some case studies where both public and private apps were used to extend CMS functionality.</li>
            <li><span>7:00pm - Setting up an App</span>    
             We will use the Shopify app_gem to set up and authenticate a new Rails application with a Shopify development store. This will act as the base for our private embedded app.</li>

            Once we have the base Rails application setup, we’ll go over the resources available through the Admin API. We’ll talk about how to make authorized requests to the API from our applications and start to display some shop data on the page.</li>
